# Simple Go WSMAN library

This Go WSMAN library is a simple WSMAN message builder and parser. It does parse WSMAN body into map[string]interface{} and build basic WSMAN request based on template. It does not attempt to verify the correctness of the WSMAN messages nor capable of programmatically creating WSMAN object.
